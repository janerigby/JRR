''' This is code to compute and apply the barycentric velocity correction, as defined in jskycalc documentation.
Adapted from https://gist.github.com/StuartLittlefair/5aaf476c5d7b52d20aa9544cfaa936a1
Eventually such a wrapper function will get written into astropy.  In the meantime, using this stopgap.
I have verified that this code gives the same answers as jskycalc, for a few positions,
and a few observatories (Las Campanas and Keck), to within 0.01 km/s.

  Uses the ephemeris set with  ``astropy.coordinates.solar_system_ephemeris.set`` for corrections. 
  For more information see `~astropy.coordinates.solar_system_ephemeris`.
  
  Parameters
  ----------
  mytime : `~astropy.time.Time`
    The time of observation.
  skycoord: `~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord`
    The sky location to calculate the correction for.
  location: `~astropy.coordinates.EarthLocation`, optional
    The location of the observatory to calculate the correction for.
    If no location is given, the ``location`` attribute of the Time
    object is used
    
  Returns
  -------
  vel_corr : `~astropy.units.Quantity`
    The velocity correction to convert to Barycentric velocities. Should be added to the original
    velocity.
